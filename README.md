# Social Buzz 
## Introduction
Accenture has embarked on a 3-month pilot with Social Buzz to focus on three main tasks aimed at addressing some of the company's biggest challenges. One of the tasks was to conduct an analysis of the data to find insights regarding the top 5 most popular categories of content on the platform. The Data Analytics team was tasked with this responsibility and the following report provides an overview of the work that was done.

## Problem
Social Buzz has reached enormous scale in recent years, which comes with a lot of data challenges. The platform receives over 100,000 posts per day, amounting to 36,500,000 posts every year, which is all unstructured data. In this age, content is king and the value of the data lies in understanding and crunching the content to gain a deeper understanding of the audience and to provide a more personalized and enjoyable experience.

## Process
The team followed a five-step process to complete the task:

* Data understanding: The team took the time to understand the data model and domain of the business.
* Data extraction: The team architected an ideal dataset for the problem and extracted it from the relevant data sources.
* Data processing and modeling: The team processed and modeled the raw data into a dataset that can precisely answer the business questions and produce analytics.
* Analysis and Visualization: With the new dataset, the team used their analytical expertise to uncover insights and produce visualizations to describe the insights.
* Recommendations: The team used the insights to make recommendations on next steps.
## Results
The team found a total of 16 unique categories of posts across the sample dataset, with the most common category being Travel. The top 5 most popular categories of posts were Technology, Animals, Travel, Science, and Culture in descending order. Culture had a popularity score of almost 120,907, showing that users favor "real-life" content on the platform. Furthermore, the team found that December was the most common month for users to post, which presents a huge opportunity for Social Buzz to differentiate its platform and run specific content or events linked to the global event.

## Conclusion
The Data Analytics team was successful in finding the top 5 most popular categories of posts on Social Buzz's platform. The results show that users favor "real-life" content and the team found that Travel was the third most popular category, presenting a massive opportunity for Social Buzz to ride on the global event. The team is ready to take the analysis to the next stage and has the expertise within Accenture to help Social Buzz realize these insights in production across the organization and in real-time.
